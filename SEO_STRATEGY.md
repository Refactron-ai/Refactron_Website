## Multi-Subdomain SEO Architecture

Refactron uses a multi-subdomain architecture to optimize SEO for different user journeys:

### 1. Main Domain (refactron.dev)
- **Purpose**: Marketing and product information
- **Target Audience**: Prospective users, researchers
- **Key Pages**: Homepage, Case Studies, About, Privacy, Terms
- **SEO Focus**: High-priority keywords, brand awareness
- **Priority**: 1.0 (Homepage), 0.7-0.8 (Other pages)

### 2. Documentation Subdomain (docs.refactron.dev)
- **Purpose**: Technical documentation and developer resources
- **Target Audience**: Developers, technical users
- **Key Content**: API Reference, Tutorials, CLI Workflows, Security
- **SEO Focus**: Technical queries, "how to" searches
- **Priority**: 0.9

### 3. Application Subdomain (app.refactron.dev)
- **Purpose**: Authentication and user application access
- **Target Audience**: Active users, new signups
- **Key Pages**: Login, Signup, Email Verification, Password Reset
- **SEO Focus**: Brand searches, direct access queries
- **Priority**: 0.9 (Main), 0.8 (Auth pages)
- **Dynamic SEO**: Route-specific meta tags for optimal indexing

### Subdomain SEO Best Practices
1. **Separate Sitemaps**: Each subdomain should have its own sitemap.xml
2. **Canonical URLs**: Always use subdomain-specific canonical URLs
3. **Cross-Domain Linking**: Strategic internal links between subdomains
4. **Consistent Branding**: Same logo, colors, and messaging across all subdomains
5. **Independent Robots.txt**: Each subdomain references all sitemaps in main robots.txt
